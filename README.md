# Application: Productivity

## Alfred üï∫
This is **Default Launcher**([Link](./application/alfred/README.md)), it has more feature than Spotlight.  
* can search anything in my mac.
* can search something in web without fousing web browser.
* can store/get in clipboard, text, image, and file.

## Better Touch Tool üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

All inputs through mac can customized as you want if you have **Better Touch Tool**.  

I have a another keyboard, but sometimes I have to use keyboard of this mac.  
When I push <kbd>fn</kbd>, I can press function key. But it is awkward to press function key in IDEA.  
So I just mapped number key to function using [Better Touch Tool](./application/better_touch_tool/README.md).

## Contexts üëØ 

Contexts manages all windows and application in my mac.  
When you want to switch between application, you press <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd>.  
Or when you want to switch windows between in a application, you press <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd>.  
But if you have more windows as a full screen, the switching is not working as you want. 

[Contexts](https://contexts.co/) enable to switch windows as I want.  
Just try to use this app.

## Things 3 üòü

Have you heard *GTD*? 
> 'Getting Things Done' is a time management method, ...  
>  from wikipedia

When you are focusing on something, there are times when an idea suddenly comes to mind.  
You do not have to worry about missing that idea anymore.

1. Just put in idea, [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/).
2. Get it from Things when you want.
3. Do it.

# Application: Utility

## Chrome

This is **Default Web Brower**([Link](./application/chrome/README.md)), it has more extension.  
Specially, I use 1Password extension to fill login information. 

## 1Passowrd

If you stil rememeber you **password**, **license**, and **some secret thing**   
or write them to note app/a piece of papepr, 
You can write them into [1Password](https://1password.com/) and get them when/what you want.

This app also supports IOS, web, and Andorid.

## Spark

Email clients, That's all.

## Amphetamine

This [app](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) keeps awake mac.  
I know there are many app and workflows.  
But this is simple and good to me.

## Dozer

You know [Bartender3](https://www.macbartender.com/). Dozer can hides status icon too.  
There are two points and you just drag it to hide icon.
