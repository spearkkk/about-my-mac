# Alfred
This is awesome launcher app. You would be happy if you install [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/).  f
**Setting from iCloud**: `iCloud/application/alferd/`  

## Theme
I revised color and font for [appearence](./gruvbox_dark.alfredappearance) based on **gruvbox**.  
!! You must should install 'Hack Nerd' [font](../../../../#font--color-scheme) if you use this appearence.
